# Home_Assistant
Empty repository for future home assistant I want to design.

Current Build in mind:
- Assistant intelligence powered by some open source local LLM  
- Possibly continuously running on some home server
- Uses some Amazon Alexa like home microphone/speaker combo to be accesses form anywhere in the house

Current Features in mind:
- Kitchen assistant:
  - Maintains a list of current ingredients in your kitchen
  - Can use this information to provide recipes for dishes you could make
  - Can remind you of what you need to get from the grocery store
